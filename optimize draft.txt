Test sp_BlitzFirst with the new table dbo.BelloBlitzIndex  created by me 
Analyse a group of problem pointed: 100-Non-Unique clustered indexes with more usage or size: PatientInformation
If you don't create then SQL server will. to overcome this problem, use random  Clustered Key. But you will have to deal with hard PageSplits
	SQL Server can avoid a complete scan of the Index in the leaf level because physical sorting order.
	create a cluster index, you have single hotspot at the end of your Index;
	Why is not created? why a identity column as a primary key?

execute the command sp_help, sp_depends to compare different the primary key shown for output tables
Refers to Index_info.sql commented with sys.index and compare to sp_BlitzIndex
Conclusion: There is some duplicate objects id but one with names, other without names and index=0
Suggestions: we should purge the DB of these objects
fill the documentation for the time frame 30'

Analyses output of Blit_Index.sql:
Fill factor hurts performance. is it a reason to use it on [APPS].[EligibilityInformation].it has a lot writes.
Watch out [APPS].[TriggerStatus] performance for multi columns index. It knows many reads(scans/seeks)
Summarize Index_info.sql output
Missing index ON PatientInformation, ClientDacore for a better perfomance
Watch out the tables TriggerStatus, ScheduledServices, EmailQueue, PatientInformation. they have a high rate of reads.

Remarks: 
1. many values are hard code ie literal. 
2. Many Foreign keys exist but are not implemented.
	how do you plan to fix them?
3. Disable a trigger by inserting the processs in APPS.TriggerStatus
4. some objects without the prefixes F_ or sp_: function, trigger ...
Questions:
1. Why not DISABLE/ENABLE the triggers? What is your politic about the triggers? convention name?
2. sp_InsertPatientCurrElig creates an insurance if it is not exist but on which status? and inserts an eligibility in PatientCurrentEligibility without check? and run sp_RecordLog
3. in PatientCurrentEligibility, EligibilityInfoID and his values V, 1, I mean what?
4. In the table InsuranceInfo, InsLevel, InsuranceType_FK, ContactType_FK : where is their lists and definition?
	What userID_FK is oding in this table?
	What mean FullNameID_FK?
	Whats mean InsuranceTypeCode? only one value "MA"
5. In sp_InsertPatientCurrElig, Which table contain the different values of hard code literal @InsEligType, ChangeStatus?
